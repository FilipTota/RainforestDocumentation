                <p>Rainforests are forests characterized by high and continuous rainfall, with annual rainfall 
                   in the case of tropical rainforests between 2.5 and 4.5 metres (98 and 177 in) and 
                   definitions varying by region for temperate rainforests. The monsoon trough, alternatively known 
                   as the intertropical convergence zone, plays a significant role in creating the climatic conditions 
                   necessary for the Earth's tropical rainforests: which are distinct from monsoonal areas of seasonal 
                   tropical forest.</p>

                <p>Tropical rainforests are characterized by a warm and wet climate with no substantial dry 
                    season: typically found within 10 degrees north and south of the equator. Mean monthly 
                    temperatures exceed 18 °C (64 °F) during all months of the year. Average annual 
                    rainfall is no less than 168 cm (66 in) and can exceed 1,000 cm (390 in) although it 
                    typically lies between 175 cm (69 in) and 200 cm (79 in).</p>

                <p>Tropical forests cover a large part of the globe, but temperate rainforests only occur in 
                    few regions around the world. Temperate rainforests are rainforests in temperate regions. 
                    They occur in North America (in the Pacific Northwest in Alaska, British Columbia, 
                    Washington, Oregon and California), in Europe (parts of the British Isles such as the 
                    coastal areas of Ireland and Scotland, southern Norway, parts of the western Balkans 
                    along the Adriatic coast, as well as in Galicia and coastal areas of the eastern Black Sea, 
                    including Georgia and coastal Turkey), in East Asia (in southern China, Highlands of Taiwan, 
                    much of Japan and Korea, and on Sakhalin Island and the adjacent Russian Far East coast), 
                    in South America (southern Chile) and also in Australia and New Zealand</p>

                <p>The emergent layer contains a small number of very large trees called emergents, which 
                    grow above the general canopy, reaching heights of 45–55 m, although on occasion a few 
                    species will grow to 70–80 m tall.[12][13] They need to be able to withstand the hot 
                    temperatures and strong winds that occur above the canopy in some areas. Eagles, 
                    butterflies, bats and certain monkeys inhabit this layer.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>The canopy layer contains the majority of the largest trees, typically 30 metres (98 ft) 
                    to 45 metres (148 ft) tall. The densest areas of biodiversity are found in the forest 
                    canopy, a more or less continuous cover of foliage formed by adjacent treetops. 
                    The canopy, by some estimates, is home to 50 percent of all plant species. Epiphytic 
                    plants attach to trunks and branches, and obtain water and minerals from rain and debris 
                    that collects on the supporting plants. The fauna is similar to that found in the emergent 
                    layer, but more diverse. A quarter of all insect species are believed to exist in the 
                    rainforest canopy. Scientists have long suspected the richness of the canopy as a habitat, 
                    but have only recently developed practical methods of exploring it. As long ago as 1917, 
                    naturalist William Beebe declared that "another continent of life remains to be discovered, 
                    not upon the Earth, but one to two hundred feet above it, extending over thousands of 
                    square miles." True exploration of this habitat only began in the 1980s, when scientists 
                    developed methods to reach the canopy, such as firing ropes into the trees using crossbows. 
                    Exploration of the canopy is still in its infancy, but other methods include the use of 
                    balloons and airships to float above the highest branches and the building of cranes and 
                    walkways planted on the forest floor. The science of accessing tropical forest canopy 
                     using airships or similar aerial platforms is called dendronautics.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>The understory or understorey layer lies between the canopy and the forest floor. It is 
                    home to a number of birds, snakes and lizards, as well as predators such as jaguars, boa 
                    constrictors and leopards. The leaves are much larger at this level and insect life is 
                    abundant. Many seedlings that will grow to the canopy level are present in the understory. 
                    Only about 5% of the sunlight shining on the rainforest canopy reaches the understory. 
                    This layer can be called a shrub layer, although the shrub layer may also be considered 
                    a separate layer.</p>

                <p>The forest floor, the bottom-most layer, receives only 2% of the sunlight. 
                    Only plants adapted to low light can grow in this region. Away from riverbanks, 
                    swamps and clearings, where dense undergrowth is found, the forest floor is relatively 
                    clear of vegetation because of the low sunlight penetration. It also contains decaying 
                    plant and animal matter, which disappears quickly, because the warm, humid conditions 
                    promote rapid decay. Many forms of fungi growing here help decay the animal and plant 
                    waste.</p>

                <p>More than half of the world's species of plants and animals are found in the rainforest. 
                    Rainforests support a very broad array of fauna, including mammals, reptiles, birds and 
                    invertebrates. Mammals may include primates, felids and other families. Reptiles include 
                    snakes, turtles, chameleons and other families; while birds include such families as 
                    vangidae and Cuculidae. Dozens of families of invertebrates are found in rainforests. 
                    Fungi are also very common in rainforest areas as they can feed on the decomposing remains 
                    of plants and animals.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>Despite the growth of vegetation in a tropical rainforest, soil quality is often quite poor. 
                    Rapid bacterial decay prevents the accumulation of humus. The concentration of iron and 
                    aluminium oxides by the laterization process gives the oxisols a bright red colour and 
                    sometimes produces mineral deposits such as bauxite. Most trees have roots near the 
                    surface, because there are insufficient nutrients below the surface; most of the trees' 
                    minerals come from the top layer of decomposing leaves and animals. On younger substrates, 
                    especially of volcanic origin, tropical soils may be quite fertile. If rainforest trees 
                    are cleared, rain can accumulate on the exposed soil surfaces, creating run-off and 
                    beginning a process of soil erosion. Eventually streams and rivers form and flooding 
                    becomes possible. There are several reasons for the poor soil quality: First is that the 
                    soil is highly acidic. The roots of plants rely on an acidity difference between the roots 
                    and the soil in order to absorb nutrients. When the soil is acidic, there is little 
                    difference, and therefore little absorption of nutrients from the soil. Second, the type 
                    of clay particles present in tropical rainforest soil has a poor ability to trap nutrients 
                    and stop them from washing away. Even if humans artificially add nutrients to the soil, 
                    the nutrients mostly wash away and are not absorbed by the plants. Thirdly, the type of 
                    clay particles present in tropical rainforest soil has a poor ability to trap nutrients 
                    and stop them from washing away. Even if humans artificially added nutrients to the soil, 
                    the nutrients would still mostly wash away and not absorbed by the plants. Finally, 
                    these soils are poor due to the high volume of rain in tropical rainforests washes 
                    nutrients out of the soil more quickly than in other climates.</p>

                <header class="text-header">Effect on global climate</header>
                <hr>
                <p>A natural rainforest emits and absorbs vast quantities of carbon dioxide. On a global scale, 
                    long-term fluxes are approximately in balance, so that an undisturbed rainforest would 
                    have a small net impact on atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, though they may have 
                    other climatic effects (on cloud formation, for example, by recycling water vapour). 
                    No rainforest today can be considered to be undisturbed. Human-induced deforestation 
                    plays a significant role in causing rainforests to release carbon dioxide, as do other 
                    factors, whether human-induced or natural, which result in tree death, such as burning 
                    and drought. Some climate models operating with interactive vegetation predict a 
                    large loss of Amazonian rainforest around 2050 due to drought, forest dieback and the 
                    subsequent release of more carbon dioxide. Five million years from now, the Amazon 
                    rainforest may long since have dried and transformed itself into savannah, killing itself 
                    in the process (changes such as this may happen even if all human deforestation activity 
                    ceases overnight).</p>

                <p>Tropical rainforests provide timber as well as animal products such as meat and hides. 
                    Rainforests also have value as tourism destinations and for the ecosystem services 
                    provided. Many foods originally came from tropical forests, and are still mostly grown 
                    on plantations in regions that were formerly primary forest. Also, plant-derived 
                    medicines are commonly used for fever, fungal infections, burns, gastrointestinal 
                    problems, pain, respiratory problems, and wound treatment. At the same time, 
                    rainforests are usually not used sustainably by non-native peoples but are being 
                    exploited or removed for agricultural purposes.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>Tropical and temperate rainforests have been subjected to heavy legal and illegal logging 
                    for their valuable hardwoods and agricultural clearance (slash-and-burn, clearcutting) 
                    throughout the 20th century and the area covered by rainforests around the world is 
                    shrinking. Biologists have estimated that large numbers of species are being driven 
                    to extinction (possibly more than 50,000 a year; at that rate, says E. O. Wilson of 
                    Harvard University, a quarter or more of all species on Earth could be exterminated 
                    within 50 years) due to the removal of habitat with destruction of the rainforests.</p>

                <p>Another factor causing the loss of rainforest is expanding urban areas. Littoral 
                   rainforest growing along coastal areas of eastern Australia is now rare due to 
                   ribbon development to accommodate the demand for seachange lifestyles.</p>

                <p>Forests are being destroyed at a rapid pace. Almost 90% of West Africa's rainforest has 
                    been destroyed. Since the arrival of humans, Madagascar has lost two thirds of its 
                    original rainforest. At present rates, tropical rainforests in Indonesia would be logged 
                    out in 10 years and Papua New Guinea in 13 to 16 years. According to Rainforest Rescue, 
                    an important reason for the increasing deforestation rate, especially in Indonesia, is 
                    the expansion of oil palm plantations to meet growing demand for cheap vegetable fats and 
                    biofuels. In Indonesia, palm oil is already cultivated on nine million hectares and, 
                    together with Malaysia, the island nation produces about 85 percent of the world's palm oil.</p>
